üéØMotivation:

<p align="justify">
    Usually anyone do not observe üïµüèª or monitor where his/her money got spent. Specially, students are not aware about their cashflow üí∏ and they do not realize, how much money they are spending and where. So, me and my collegue <a href="https://github.com/MilanPatel28" target="_blank">Milan Patel</a> have decided to make one stop solution for this problem. ü§ù We have develpoed ExpenseGraphica to help you to monitor your cashflow.
